# How to run kernel configuration:
# "ask"  - use config from previous kernel, ask user for new symbols
# empty (default) - use config from previous kernel, and apply defaults for
#                   new symbols. Fully automated for unattended upgrades.

# Delete obsolete kernels, keep only the currently used and the new one.
# Remove kernel sources, keep only headers required to compile kernel modules.
# This makes kernel headers available for sharing.

# Pack all kernel modules into a tgz archive in /boot for sharing.
# Useful when combined with a webserver to pull binary kernel from here.
# If you intend to use the compiled kernel only on one machine, it is safe
# to say no here.
SHARE=n

# Where to pull the shared binary kernel from. The shared kernel must
# be downloadable from: https://$PULL_FROM/boot/
# All required files are created by the "SHARE=y" parameter in /boot path,
# which can be put directly into a webroot of a webserver for sharing.
# Space separated list of domains is allowed.
